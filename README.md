# BioMadeGPT
Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain.

Quick Start with Huggingface's transformers

Note:
We emphasize that BiomedGPT, including its files, code, and checkpoints, is strictly for academic research purposes. Commercial and clinical uses are strictly prohibited for three key reasons: First, BiomedGPT is based on the OFA framework, which carries a non-commercial license that we have inherited. Second, our model is not licensed for use in healthcare settings. Finally, we have not implemented sufficient security measures, and the current model cannot guarantee the accuracy required for medical diagnoses.

Warning: Extensive experiments using transformers have not been conducted, so cannot confirm whether the results from transformers and fairseq are fully aligned.
